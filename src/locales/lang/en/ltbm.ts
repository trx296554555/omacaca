		background: 'Background',
		background1:
			'For several decades, understanding ageing and the processes that limit lifespan have challenged biologists. \
			Thirty years ago, the biology of ageing gained unprecedented scientific credibility through the identification \
			of gene variants that extend the lifespan of multicellular model organisms.\
			Now ageing research is entering a new era that has unique medical, commercial and societal implications.\
			(Figure: Timeline of ageing research, Judith Campisi et.al., Nature, 2019)',
		background2:
			'The past 30 years of ageing research has transitioned from identifying ageing phenotypes to investigating the genetic pathways that underlie these phenotypes.\
		The genetics of ageing research has revealed a complex network of interacting intracellular signalling pathways and higher-order processes.\
		Many of the pathways and processes, such as dietary restriction, that have been identified are known to be critical in homeostatic responses to environmental change.',
		background3:
			'Various factors such as race, living environment, eating habits and health status will affect the aging process,\
		which makes it very important to select an appropriate biological model to establish a benign relationship between aging mechanism and human clinical transformation.',
		background4:
			'Macaca are closely related to human beings and are currently the most important non-human primate model \
			animals in human disease research and clinical drug development.',
		description: 'Description',
		description1:
			'We performed a long-term tracking on captivity macaques, monitored the indicators and environmental information during its growth and development.\
		For the mean time, a large amount of blood transcriptomic, blood metabolomic, the oral and intestinal metagenomic data were obtained.\
		Through bioinformatics methods, the corresponding data were analyzed to explore the changes of gene expression in macaques during the aging process,\
		and identify the genes and signaling pathways closely related to aging.',
		description2:
			'Focusing on changes in known gene expression associated with cardiovascular disease and immunity in humans.\
		And combined with molecular experiment and measurement of blood routine, coagulation and other indicators, \
		to reveal the similarities and differences of the effects of aging on gene expression in macaques and humans, \
		and provide molecular data support for macaques in the field of human aging research and the establishment of suitable aging model.',

		stagea: 'First sampling, 21 baby monkeys lived with their mothers in adult housing; \
			Baby monkeys eat mainly breast milk but may pick up food from their mothers.',
		stageanote:
			'After sampling, the 21 baby monkeys were separated from their mothers and placed in a large cage.',
		stageb: 'Second sampling, 21 baby monkeys lived in a large cage (monkey kindergarten). Diet formula was baby monkey feed + fruit + milk powder.',

		stagecnote:
			'After sampling, stop feeding milk powder and transfer to a small cage (2 per a cage) in the veterinary room',
		staged: 'Fourth sampling, every two baby monkeys lived in a small cage. Diet formula was baby monkey feed + fruit + special additives.',
		stagednote:
			'Special additives include: JianPiGaoPian 0.8g + Vitamin B complex 0.1g + Vitamin C 0.1g, sometimes may extra add: 1 dry yeast tablet.\
		The above additives began to be added on November 15 and stopped to be added on December 01.',
		stagee: 'Fifth sampling, every two baby monkeys lived in a small cage. Diet formula was baby monkey feed + fruit',
		stagef: 'Sixth sampling, the 21 baby monkeys were back in the large cage (monkey kindergarten),\
		but the density of the group was lower than the second and third sampleing. Diet formula was new baby monkey feed + fruit',
		stagefnote:
			'Depending on the growth and development, 17 of the baby monkeys were transferred to cage 12-3 on March 11, 2020,\
		and 2 were transferred to cage 11-1 and 11-3 at the end of March, respectively.\
		The other two BCR03 and BCR20 had diarrhea during the sampling period and were treated in a small cage in the veterinary room.\
		They did not take medicine before and on the sampling day and were recovering, but they became emaciated and weak obviously.',
		stageg: 'Seventh sampling, 21 baby monkeys lived in the large cage (monkey kindergarten). Diet formula was new baby monkey feed + fruit',
		stagegnote:
			'The two monkeys, BCR03 and BCR20, had developed diarrhea and under treatment were dead before this sampling',
